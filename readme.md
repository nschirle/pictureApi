npm run test will run the jasmine unit tests
npm run start will start the server listening locally on port 3000

I have a kubernetes cluster setup for testing, I need to integrate cloud storage as right now photos are stored locally to the containers.

run these to test my service:
http://20.80.141.134:3000/photo //health endpoint
http://20.80.141.134:3000/photo/
